Projects
Handwritten Digit Recognition
Tools and Technologies: Python, Streamlit, OpenCV, TensorFlow
Developed an interactive web application that allows users to upload images of handwritten digits, processes the 
images through custom image processing techniques, segments them, and predicts the digits using a CNN model 
trained on the MNIST dataset. Enabled users to adjust preprocessing parameters dynamically for better 
visualization and understanding.
Obesity Prediction: A Machine Learning Approach (Team Project)
Role: Developer
Tools and Technologies: Python, Scikit-learn, Light
GBM, Pandas, GridSearchCV
Contributed to building a machine learning pipeline for predicting obesity levels (NObeyesdad) based on 
demographic, lifestyle, and dietary inputs. Developed preprocessing pipelines using ColumnTransformer and 
Pipeline to handle categorical encoding, scaling, and missing values. Participated in feature selection and model 
evaluation processes using Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Light
GBM.
Dynamic Console Menu System using Object-Oriented Design
Tools and Technologies: C, Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Built an extensible C library for designing interactive console menus, applying OOP principles (abstraction, 
inheritance, polymorphism). Supported dynamic navigation, nested menus, and customizable user actions.
