Projects
Transformer Implementation with Deployment
Implemented a Transformer model from scratch in PyTorch for educational purposes.Includes multi-head 
attention, positional encoding, and support for classification/regression.Features attention visualization 
with Streamlit for hands-on experimentation.
lung CT-Scan Segmentation
Developed a lung CT scan segmentation model using TensorFlow and U-Net architecture.The model detects 
lung regions by applying convolutional layers, skip connections, and upsampling for precise 
segmentation.Trained on labeled CT scan datasets, achieving accurate segmentation for medical image 
analysis.
Hate Speech Classification
Built a hate speech classifier using NLP and machine learning.Preprocessed text, applied TF-IDF or 
embeddings, and trained models like Logistic Regression or BERT.Evaluated using accuracy and F1-
score.Supports automated content moderation.
Text Analysis and Clustering
Unsupervised learning is used to cluster similar text data. The text is preprocessed using techniques like 
tokenization and stopword removal. It is then converted into numerical vectors using TF-IDF or embeddings. 
Clustering is performed using models like K-Means, with evaluation via silhouette scores and a modular, 
well-logged pipeline.
Sign Language Translator
Developed a real-time hand gesture recognition system using MediaPipe and OpenCV for data collection and 
preprocessing.Trained a TensorFlow/Keras model to classify sign language gestures, optionally using a CNN 
architecture.The system uses a webcam for live detection and translates gestures into text output.
Self-Driving Robot, Hand Gesture detector(Graduation Project: Assistant Robot)
Built an assistant robot that tracks its owner using hand gestures, localization, and obstacle 
avoidance.Hand gestures are detected in real-time using CVzones HandTrackingModule with five predefined 
commands.Obstacle avoidance is handled by a YOLOX model fine-tuned on 80 COCO classes.These 
components enable the robot to follow its owner while navigating safely around obstacles.
